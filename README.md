# Numerical Approximation of Definite Integrals
**<h1>Purpose</h1>**  
If the current reference is in the direction of the voltage drop across the terminals of the inductor as shown in Figure 1, the power p(t) is

p(t)=v(t)i(t)     (1)

where v(t) is the voltage in Volts [V] and i(t) is the current in Amperes [A]. The power p(t) is in Watts [W]. Knowing that the power is the time rate of expending energy and assuming a reference for a zero energy corresponds to zero current in the inductor, the stored energy w(t) in Joules [J] can be given as

w(t)= ∫_0^t〖p(t)dt〗= ∫_0^t〖v(t)i(t)dt〗     (2)

Using the voltage-current relation of the inductor, the stored energy can also be found as

w(t)=  1/2 Li^2 (t)    (3)
